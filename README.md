# AI-Based-Real-Estate-Valuation-System


🏠 AI-Based Real Estate Validation System
📖 Overview

The AI-Based Real Estate Validation System is an intelligent machine learning application designed to analyze and validate real estate property details such as area, location, number of bedrooms, price, and property age. It helps users verify whether a listed property price is genuine, underpriced, or overpriced based on real-world data trends.

This project uses Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) algorithms to provide accurate predictions and improve transparency in the real estate market. The system ensures buyers, sellers, and agents make more informed decisions by validating property prices efficiently.

🎯 Objective

The main goal of this project is to:

Predict the true or estimated market value of a property based on its characteristics.

Validate the authenticity of property prices listed on real estate websites.

Reduce fraudulent pricing and misleading property information.

Provide a simple and interactive web interface using Streamlit for real-time predictions.

🧠 Key Features

✅ Machine Learning Model – Trained on historical real estate data to predict accurate prices.
✅ Price Validation – Compares predicted price vs. listed price to check if it’s valid or not.
✅ Interactive Interface – Built using Streamlit for an easy-to-use frontend.
✅ Real-Time Prediction – Users can input property details and instantly get validation results.
✅ Data Visualization – Graphs and charts to display model performance and data trends.

🏗️ System Architecture

Data Collection – Dataset collected from real estate sources (CSV files with attributes like area, bedrooms, price, location, age, etc.).

Data Preprocessing – Cleaning, normalization, and feature selection.

Model Training – Using machine learning algorithms (like Linear Regression, Random Forest, or XGBoost) to train the prediction model.

Model Evaluation – Performance metrics such as RMSE, R² Score, and Accuracy are used.

Model Deployment – The trained model is saved using Joblib and integrated with a Streamlit app for user interaction.
